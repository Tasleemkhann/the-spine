                                    In 2018, Neeraj Tiwari suffered a severe spinal injury, resulting in a loss of motor
                                    control and sensation in his lower limbs. After surgery, he was transferred to VN
                                    Desai Hospital for financial reasons. Under Dr. Gaurish Kenkre’s Spine Foundation
                                    Rehab Team, Neeraj worked on trunk control, balance, and upper body strength.
                                    Through persistent efforts, he progressed from sitting independently to walking with
                                    minimal support, improving his muscle strength significantly and he made a change
                                    from being entirely dependent on walking aids to walking alone with little help.

                                    Reshma Khan, 22, of Kandivali, suffered from severe TB spondylodiscitis, which
                                    affected her bladder and spine and left her paralysed from the waist down. MRI
                                    results confirmed spinal cord compression. She had Hartshill fixation and spine
                                    decompression at VN Desai Hospital. Surprisingly, ten days after the surgery, she
                                    was able to walk with little assistance. Reshma's recovery from paralysis to freedom
                                    serves as an example of both her persistence and the success of medical care.

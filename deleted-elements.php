                        Spine care has long been considered an expensive urban privilege, often out of reach for
                        those in rural areas. The Spine Foundation recognised the profound inequality in access
                        to specialised spinal care, for people at the bottom of the pyramid. It doesn’t just
                        affect the patient’s life, but the lives of family and community as well.

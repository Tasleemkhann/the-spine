                                The concrete heart of the metropolis beats with unrelenting vigour, blind to the
                                countless silent battles fought within. Beneath, overlooked casualties of the
                                unrelenting rush of the metropolis, hunched figures struggle with back pain. Crammed
                                commutes and pressure to satisfy demands rob mobility, pushing them into the shadows of
                                progress. The Spine Foundation fights to guarantee that everyone has access to
                                healthcare as a birthright rather than as a privilege.

                                Our commitment to fostering excellence in spinal healthcare is reflected in our
                                comprehensive training programs. These programs are meticulously designed to empower
                                healthcare professionals and young orthopaedic surgeons, equipping them with the
                                necessary skills to evolve into proficient spine surgeons. Through hands-on
                                training, mentorship, and access to cutting-edge resources, we strive to nurture a
                                new generation of healthcare professionals capable of delivering high-quality spinal
                                care.

                                    Our mission transcends mere medical intervention; it’s about empowering individuals
                                    to reclaim control over their lives. We understand that spinal health impacts every
                                    aspect of a person’s well-being, from physical mobility to emotional resilience.

                                Despite the specific challenges these little fighters had to overcome, The Spine
                                Foundation would not accept anything less than the best. To provide these kids with
                                the
                                best opportunity for a long, healthy life, they utilised the most recent advances in
                                science and modern treatments. The paediatric unit at The Spine Foundation was more
                                than
                                simply a facility to fix backs—it was a place where kids could receive the
                                specialised
                                care they required to fulfil their potential.

                                The fellowship is carried out in various tertiary care institutes in Mumbai including
                                Lilavati Hospital, New Age Wockhardt Hospital (Mumbai Central) and Breach Candy
                                Hospital. Part of fellowship also includes exposure to peripheral centres like VN Desai
                                Municipal hospital. Fellows are expected to gain expertise in all major areas of current
                                orthopaedic spine practice including degenerative, trauma, infection, deformity
                                correction and neoplasms. Over the course of this two-year program, fellows take on
                                progressively increasing clinical responsibilities.

                    The Spine Foundation has been fostering the ambitions of aspiring surgeons and fostering a tradition
                    of superior spinal care for more than 20 years since its inception in 1998. Our carefully crafted
                    two-year fellowship programme enables board-certified orthopaedic surgeons to further develop their
                    craft and become expert spinal experts.

                    Just think of the important impact that a highly skilled surgeon can have on countless needy lives.
                    That very idea is embodied in this fellowship programme. It gives fellows—referred to as The Spine
                    Foundation Fellows—the skills they need to handle the challenges associated with spinal surgery.
                    Fellows receive intense training that covers a wide range of topics, including complex surgical
                    methods, careful patient assessment and diagnosis, and superior postoperative care.

                    This is not only about learning new techniques; it's also about commitment, determination, and a
                    deep awareness of the suffering that people with spinal conditions experience. Through the Spine
                    Foundation Fellowship, experienced surgeons mentor and inspire the upcoming generation in a spirit
                    of mentorship. It is a testament to our undying commitment to creating a future in which everyone
                    has access to excellent spinal care.

                                The Spine Foundation's aim extends beyond just treating and operating on spinal
                                disorders. Our main objective is to start a ground-breaking movement in accessible
                                public healthcare, with a focus on spine conditions. We think that giving people the
                                information and abilities they require is the first step towards bringing about
                                long-lasting change. These people can then carry forward our vision and act as agents of
                                change by becoming experts in their own right. Through our selfless sharing of knowledge
                                and experience, we not only aim to greatly enhance the quality of life for each patient
                                but also play a larger role in the development of stronger and healthier communities.

                                healthcare professionals and young orthopaedic surgeons, equipping them with the
                                necessary skills to evolve into proficient spine surgeons. Through hands-on training,
                                mentorship, and access to cutting-edge resources, we strive to nurture a new generation

                                Our goal is to change lives, not merely treat them. We achieve this by providing
                                detailed educational programmes that create a desire for superior spine care. Imagine
                                working with a network of highly qualified individuals who are prepared to relieve pain

                                We do not function in a lonely environment. Our training programmes remain at the

                                educational institutions. This encourages innovation and a never-ending search for fresh
                                approaches that improve the health of patients.
